## Parameter Studies

### Run series 1: Resolution study
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Goal: Test convergence
- Varied: particle number (10k, 50k, 100k, 500k)
- Result: Converged at N > 50k
- Output: output/resolution_study/

### Run series 2: ...

## Validation

### Test 1: Sedov blast wave
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Result: Matches analytical solution to 2%
- Figures: figures/validation/sedov_blast.png

### Test 2: ...
